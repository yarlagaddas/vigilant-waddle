Explanation:
Library Component (SwftTriggerEformComponent):

This component initializes by calling a service to fetch the list of forms based on the provided channel.
It opens a dialog to select forms when the "Select Eform" button is clicked.
The dialog is implemented by SwftSelectEformsComponent.
Dialog Component (SwftSelectEformsComponent):

This component displays a form to select eForms from a list.
It filters the list of eForms based on user input.
Selected eForms are emitted to the parent component.
Service (SwftTriggerEformService):

This service fetches the list of forms from an API based on the provided channel.
It handles API errors and shows a snackbar message if an error occurs.
Consuming Application:

AppComponent uses the SwftTriggerEformComponent and passes the channel "AWARE" to it.
It handles the eformSearch event to process selected forms.
Module (AppModule):

This module declares and imports necessary components and modules required for the application to run.
This setup provides a complete flow from the consuming application to the library component, which opens a dialog for selecting eForms, and handles the selected eForms back in the consuming application.
