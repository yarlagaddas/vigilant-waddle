Explanation of Flow
AppComponent:

Defines a channel input that will be passed to the SwftTriggerEformComponent.
Handles the eformSearch event emitted by the SwftTriggerEformComponent.
SwftTriggerEformComponent:

Receives the channel input and uses it to fetch the list of eForms via the SwftTriggerEformService.
Provides a button that, when clicked, opens a dialog (implemented by SwftSelectEformsComponent) to select eForms.
Listens to the selectedEformDataEvent and eFormsFromRequestTypes events emitted by the SwftSelectEformsComponent to handle selected eForms and eForm search events.
SwftSelectEformsComponent:

Displays a form with a dropdown to select eForms.
Filters the list of eForms based on user input.
Emits selectedEformDataEvent when forms are selected and eFormsFromRequestTypes to request eForms based on the channel.
SwftTriggerEformService:

Fetches the list of eForms based on the provided channel from an API.
Handles errors and displays a snackbar message if an error occurs.
This complete flow ensures that the consuming application can use the library to select eForms, with the list of eForms being dynamically fetched based on the provided channel.
